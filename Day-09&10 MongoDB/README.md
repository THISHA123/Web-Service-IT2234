Why We Use MongoDB?

    We use MongoDB when we want a fast, flexible, scalable, easy-to-develop database solution â€” especially when 
    traditional SQL databases would feel too heavy or rigid.
    
Key Terms
    - Database: Holds collections.
    - Collection: Like a table (stores documents).
    - Document: BSON-style object.
    - _id: Auto-generated, unique identifier.
    
Create a Database and Collection
- Create Database -> Database Name -> Collection Name -> Create Database
